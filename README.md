# Codacy Reek

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```
sbt universal:stage
docker build -t codacy-reek .
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.

## Update Version with Docs

```sh
bundle update
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
./scripts/doc_generate.sh <docs_location>
```

Notes on the documentation generation:
- You need to *require* the plugin, so they are injected on the *registry* when fetching the available Cops
- After the `bundle install` the documentation generator will fetch examples from the Cops of the added plugins
